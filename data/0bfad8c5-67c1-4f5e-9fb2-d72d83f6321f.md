A type of [[766143eb-533c-48e4-97e3-61aa7a09f948]] Polymorphism that allows one to write programs that are polymorphic on record field types.

Records can be typed as an unordered [[947518fc-90f7-4ed9-979e-4fe396a6024f]] Tuples of labeled types. These are also called rows (of types). As mentioned in this [paper on extensible records](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/scopedlabels.pdf) and in the [PureScript documentation](https://github.com/purescript/documentation/blob/master/language/Types.md#rows), records may have duplicate labels so a good conceptual mental model is that a row is a `Map Label (NonEmptyList Type)`. The following notation represents a closed row.

$\langle t_1: T_1, \ldots, t_k: T_k \rangle$

Row polymorphism extends records with a polymorphic variable $\rho$ that can be instantiated to another row. The following notation represents an open row (extensible through $\rho$).

$\langle t_1: T_1, \ldots, t_k: T_k | \rho \rangle$

This is useful because it allows a type to accept records with more fields than it has declared itself. We can define functions that operate on *parts of a record* without downcasting, which causes loss of type information. The type information is preserved in $\rho$. In the following example, the polymorphic variable `r` gets instantiated to `{ likes: ["music", "programming"] }`.

``` purescript
updateName :: forall r. { name :: String | r } -> { name :: String | r }
updateName x = x { name = "Mr. " <> x.name }

updateName { name: "Nutty", likes: ["music", "programming"] }
-- { likes: ["music","programming"], name: "Mr. Nutty" }
```
