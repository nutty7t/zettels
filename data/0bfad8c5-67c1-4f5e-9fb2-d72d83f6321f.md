title: Row Polymorphism
---

A type of [polymorphism] that allows one to write programs that are polymorphic
on record field types.

Records can be typed as an unordered [sequence] of labeled types. These are
also called rows (of types). As mentioned in this [paper on extensible records]
and in the [PureScript documentation], records may have duplicate labels so a
good conceptual mental model is that a row is a `Map Label (NonEmptyList
Type)`. The following notation represents a closed row.

$$\langle t_1: T_1, \ldots, t_k: T_k \rangle$$

Row polymorphism extends records with a polymorphic variable $\rho$ that can be
instantiated to another row. The following notation represents an open row
(extensible through $\rho$).

$$\langle t_1: T_1, \ldots, t_k: T_k | \rho \rangle$$

This is useful because it allows a type to accept records with more fields than
it has declared itself. We can define functions that operate on *parts of a
record* without downcasting, which causes loss of type information. The type
information is preserved in $\rho$. In the following example, the polymorphic
variable `r` gets instantiated to `{ likes: ["music", "programming"] }`.

``` purescript
updateName :: forall r. { name :: String | r } -> { name :: String | r }
updateName x = x { name = "Mr. " <> x.name }

updateName { name: "Nutty", likes: ["music", "programming"] }
-- { likes: ["music","programming"], name: "Mr. Nutty" }
```
