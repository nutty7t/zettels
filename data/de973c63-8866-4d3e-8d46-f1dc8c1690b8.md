title: Records and Product Types
---

In some sense, record types are syntactic sugar for product types that just
provide each constituent type with a label.

We could represent a person as a product type:

``` purescript
data Person = Person String String Int
```

But it's not very easy to figure out what each of the data constructor
arguments are used for by just looking at the type. To help with this, we could
write some accessor functions that document each argument by name.

``` purescript
firstName :: Person -> String
firstName (Person s _ _) = s

lastName :: Person -> String
lastName (Person _ s _) = s

age :: Person -> Int
age (Person _ _ i) = i
```

Using the record notation syntax, we can write:

``` purescript
import Prelude
import Effect.Console

type Person
  = { firstName :: String
    , lastName :: String
    , age :: Int
    }

singer :: Person
singer =
  { firstName: "Hatsune"
  , lastName: "Miku"
  , age: 16
  }

log $ singer.firstName <> " " <> singer.lastName
-- Hatsune Miku
```

Arguably, the record notation is more readable, and it doesn't pollute the
global namespace with the identifiers of the accessor functions.
