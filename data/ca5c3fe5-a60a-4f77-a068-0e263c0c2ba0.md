A rubber duck session with myself.

An `Event` represents a collection of discrete values that are each associated with a time. In other words, an `Event` represents a list of occurrences. They can be modeled conceptually as

``` purescript
type Event a = List { value :: a, time :: Time }
```

This looks different (and rather scary-looking) from the type definition of `Event` in [purescript-event](https://github.com/paf31/purescript-event/blob/v1.2.4/src/FRP/Event.purs#L39-L39).

``` purescript
newtype Event a = Event ((a -> Effect Unit) -> Effect (Effect Unit))
```

In order to construct an `Event`, I can see that we need some function that accepts a callback function `a -> Effect Unit` as an argument and returns an `Effect (Effect Unit)`. At this point, I'm just reading these types at face value. I don't have any semantics that I can give to them.

...OH! I think that I get it now.

We can think `((a -> Effect Unit) -> Effect (Effect Unit))` as an event generator, something that can generate events over time. `a -> Effect Unit` is a consumer of these events and `Effect Unit` is a canceler function that can stop the event generator. The event generator has the side-effect of generating events and pushing events to the consumer so the canceler is wrapped: `Effect (Effect Unit)`.
