title: PureScript Event Type

An `Event` represents a collection of discrete values that are each associated with a time. In other words, an `Event` represents a list of occurrences. They can be modeled conceptually as

``` purescript
type Event a = List { value :: a, time :: Time }
```

This looks different (and rather scary-looking) from the type definition of `Event` in [purescript-event](https://github.com/paf31/purescript-event/blob/v1.2.4/src/FRP/Event.purs#L39-L39).

``` purescript
newtype Event a = Event ((a -> Effect Unit) -> Effect (Effect Unit))
```

Let's break this down. `((a -> Effect Unit) -> Effect (Effect Unit))` can be thought of as an event generator that emits occurrences over time. It accepts a callback function `a -> Effect Unit` as an argument that consumes each occurrence that is emitted and returns a function `Effect Unit` that can cancel the generation of events. Because the generator function is effectful, the return type is wrapped in another effect: `Effect (Effect Unit)`.

``` purescript
type EventConsumer = a -> Effect Unit
type EventCanceler = Effect Unit
type EventGenerator = EventConsumer -> Effect EventCanceler
newtype Event a = Event EventGenerator
```
