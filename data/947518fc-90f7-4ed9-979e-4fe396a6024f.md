A **tuple** is a finite ordered sequence of elements. In PureScript, a tuple can be constructed with the following constructor, `Tuple a b`.

``` purescript
> import Data.Tuple

> Tuple 7 true
(Tuple 7 true)

> :t Tuple 7 true
Tuple Int Boolean
```

It has kind `* -> * -> *`, which lets us work with ordered pairs but we can work with n-tuples by nesting pairs together.

``` purescript
> import Data.Tuple

> -- Could represent the 3D coordinate: (1, 2, 3)
> Tuple 1 (Tuple 2 (Tuple 3 unit))
```

`/\` is a right-associative operator alias for the `Tuple` constructor, so we could have also constructed the coordinate with `1 /\ 2 /\ 3 /\ unit`. The `Data.Tuple.Nested` module also provides some utility functions for constructing n-tuples:

``` purescript
> import Data.Tuple.Nested

> tuple3 1 2 3
(Tuple 1 (Tuple 2 (Tuple 3 unit)))
```

The [module documentation](https://pursuit.purescript.org/packages/purescript-tuples/4.1.0) mentions that you shouldn't represent data using nested tuples, but they're sometimes useful for translating to and from more traditional product types. This is probably because it's easy to confuse the components of a tuple when they are accessed by their index.
