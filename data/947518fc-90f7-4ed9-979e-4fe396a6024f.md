title: Tuples
---

A **tuple** is a finite ordered sequence of elements. In PureScript, a tuple
can be constructed with the following constructor, `Tuple a b`.

``` purescript
> import Data.Tuple

> Tuple 7 true
(Tuple 7 true)

> :t Tuple 7 true
Tuple Int Boolean
```

It has kind `* -> * -> *`, which lets us work with ordered pairs but we can
work with n-tuples by nesting pairs together.

``` purescript
> import Data.Tuple

> -- Could represent the 3D coordinate: (1, 2, 3)
> Tuple 1 (Tuple 2 (Tuple 3 unit))
```

`/\` is a right-associative operator alias for the `Tuple` constructor, so we
could have also constructed the coordinate with `1 /\ 2 /\ 3 /\ unit`.  The
`Data.Tuple.Nested` module also provides some utility functions for
constructing n-tuples:

``` purescript
> import Data.Tuple.Nested

> tuple3 1 2 3
(Tuple 1 (Tuple 2 (Tuple 3 unit)))
```

The [module documentation] mentions that you shouldn't represent data using
nested tuples, but they're sometimes useful for translating to and from more
traditional product types.
